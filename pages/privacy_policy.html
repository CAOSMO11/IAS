        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12">
                <p>Irish American Spirits, Inc. (“IAS”, “we”, “our” or “us”) respects your personal privacy and takes it
                    seriously. We have issued this Privacy Policy to inform you of our procedures and policies regarding
                    the collection, disclosure and use of Personal Information (as defined below) we receive or collect
                    when you interact with our brands and with us. The term “Services”, as used in this Privacy Policy,
                    refers to the IAS website, as well as each of its websites, including the following list of brand
                    websites (collectively, the “Sites”), and all IAS products or services offered by IAS online or
                    offline:</p>
                <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy is intended for United States (“U.S.”) consumers. This Privacy
                    Policy applies to information that you provide to us (or permit third party sites to provide to us)
                    or that we collect through the Services. This Privacy Policy may from time to time be updated in the
                    future. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy through the
                    Services and/or by providing alternative notice appropriate to the circumstances. IAS recommends
                    that you consult this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
                <p>By using our Services you are consenting to our Processing (as defined below) of your information as
                    described in this Privacy Policy now and as revised in the future by IAS. For purposes of this
                    Privacy Policy, “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or using, reviewing or otherwise
                    interacting with Personal Information in any way, including, storing, deleting, collecting, using,
                    combining and disclosing Personal Information and transferring it to the United States government or
                    other governments. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the
                    Services.</p>

                <h2>How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Information That You Provide or Authorize Us to Collect</p>
                <p>As you use the Services, we may collect or you may provide information that identifies, relates to or
                    directly or indirectly describes you or your household and devices (“Personal Information”).
                    Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this
                    information. For example, when you contact our customer support services, this may include a record
                    of communication correspondence and associated contact information.</p>
                <p>Social Networking Details. Where applicable, you may connect with us or sign up to receive
                    information from us through third-party social networking sites (each, a “Social Networking Site”).
                    If you decide to interact with the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the
                    Personal Information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your “real” name,
                    email address and other information you choose to provide or make available via the Social
                    Networking Site, such as phone number, age and transaction data); the information we extract may
                    depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site.</p>
                <p>Purchase and Product Usage Details. If you choose to purchase any goods through the Services, we or
                    our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you, including financial
                    information related to your method of payment, to facilitate your payment for such goods, and
                    information about your use and purchase of our products.</p>
                <p>Information You Provide When You Communicate with Us and Otherwise Use Our Services. We collect
                    information that you provide when you use the Services, including when you sign up to receive
                    marketing communications, communicate with us online or interact with us at events. The Personal
                    Information we may collect may include personal identifiers and contact information including your
                    name, contact details, birthday and zip code, and details like your individual communication and
                    privacy preferences.</p>
                <p>Device Information Collected with Your Consent. With your permission, and only if you confirm that
                    you are age 21 or older, we may access information from your device, such as device ID.</p>
                <p>Certain information we collect may be Personal Information depending on how it is combined with other
                    identifiers (for example, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address when combined with other data that
                    enables us to identify you or your household). The same pieces of information may not be Personal
                    Information when taken alone or combined only with non-identifying information.</p>
