        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the websites (the “Sites”) and other online services
            (collectively with the Sites, the “Services”)  provided by Irish American Spirits, Inc. or its legal
            affiliates - “IAS”, “we”, “our” or “us” -, including any content, functionality, features and applications
            offered on or through the Services to you as a customer or guest.</p>
        <p>The Sites are directed at and intended for your use only if you are of legal age to purchase alcohol and live
            in the United States. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU ARE NOT OF LEGAL AGE TO PURCHASE ALCOHOL, LIVE

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you use the Services. By using the Services, you agree to
            be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you violate these Terms of Service
            or our Privacy Policy in any way, your right to access or use the Services is automatically terminated.</p>

            sections below. These sections contain important information regarding restrictions on your legal rights in
            any dispute involving the Services, these Terms of Service, or our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>You understand that we may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion.
            To the extent appropriate, we may seek to provide advance notice before updated Terms of Service become
            effective. You agree that we may notify you of the updated Terms of Service by posting them on the Services
            (such as on our Sites), and that your use of the Services after the effective date of the updated Terms of
            Service (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the
            updated Terms of Service. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Service posted on the Services
            periodically so that you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
        <p>For purposes of these Terms of Service, “Personal Information” shall have the meaning used in our Privacy
            Policy.</p>

                unauthorized manner or in a manner that suggests an association with our products, services or brands.
            </li>
            <li>To access data (including user information) through unauthorized means, including by using an automated
                device, caching, script, bot, spider, crawler or scraper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Services, whether online or offline.
            You agree that IAS is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. IAS reserves the right, but has
            no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense
            and your best judgment when interacting with others.</p>
        <h2>Communications</h2>
        <p>You agree to receive email from us for customer service-related purposes and for other purposes contemplated
            by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.</p>

            communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your
            use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically
            by posting a notice on the Services or sending an email to you. You may have a legal right to receive this
            notice in writing.</p>
        <h2>Product and Service Purchases and Promotions</h2>
        <p>Making Purchases. If you wish to purchase products or services described on the Services (each such purchase,
            a “Transaction”), you will be asked by IAS or the third party provider of the product or service to supply
            certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other
            information. You understand that any such information will be treated by IAS in the manner described in our
            Privacy Policy, which can be found at Privacy Policy. You agree that all information that you provide to IAS
            or such third party provider will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred
            by you or any users of your account details and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the
            price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable
            taxes relating to your purchases. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT
            CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO INITIATE ANY TRANSACTION. By submitting such information, you grant
            IAS the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of
            Transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. Verification of information may be required prior to the
            acknowledgment or completion of any Transaction.</p>
        <p>Descriptions or images of, or references to, products or services on the Services do not imply IAS’s
            endorsement of such products or services. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to change such
            descriptions or references; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code,
            promotional code or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all Transaction(s); to
            limit the order quantity on any product or service; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or
            service. Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to IAS’s acceptance of
            any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. Refunds
            and exchanges will be subject to IAS’s refund and exchange policies then in effect.</p>
        <p>Promotions. From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes, surveys, contests and other promotional events in
            which you may choose to participate (“Promotions”). By participating in any such Promotion, you become
            subject to those rules, which may vary from these Terms of Service. You should carefully review the rules,
            if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Services. These Terms of Service will remain
            in full force and effect as long as you remain a user of the Services. To the extent there is a conflict
            between these Terms of Service and the rules of the Promotion in which you choose to participate, the
            Promotion rules shall govern.</p>
        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to access and use the
            Services for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>The Services contain content owned or licensed by IAS, including, without limitation, name, logo, text,
            images, audio/visual works, icons and scripts (“IAS Content”). IAS Content is protected by copyright,
            trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and IAS, IAS owns and retains all rights
            in IAS Content and the Services.</p>
        <p>You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights
            notices incorporated in or accompanying IAS Content, and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare
            derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or
            otherwise exploit IAS Content without the prior written permission of IAS.</p>
        <h2>Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination</h2>
        <p>We have the right:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To modify or terminate the Services for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability
                to you.</li>
            <li>To refuse, terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason,
                including, without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Service. Upon termination, all licenses
                and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Service will immediately cease.</li>
            <li>To remove, edit, block and/or monitor content on the Services containing materials that we determine in
                our sole discretion violate these Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Linking to the Services</h2>
        <p>You may link to our Site homepage, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our
            reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form
            of association, approval or endorsement on our part without our prior express written consent.</p>
        <p>The Services may provide certain social media features that enable you to: link from your own or certain
            third-party websites to certain content on our Services; send communications with certain content, or links
            to certain content, using the Services; or cause limited portions of content on the Services to be displayed
            or appear to be displayed on your own or certain third-party websites.</p>
        <p>You may use these features solely as they are provided by us, and must not otherwise: establish a link from
            any website that is not owned by you; cause the Services or portions of it to be displayed on, or appear to
            be displayed by, any other site (for example, scraping, framing, deep linking or in-line linking); or take
            any action with respect to the Services that is inconsistent with these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>We may disable any social media features and any links at any time without notice in our sole discretion.</p>
        <h2>Links on Our Services</h2>
        <p>If the Services contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are
            provided for your convenience only. This includes links contained in advertisements, including banner
            advertisements and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and
            accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you
            decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to our Services, you do so entirely at your own risk
            and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.</p>
        <h2>Services Content</h2>
        <p>We may update the content in our Services from time to time, but it will not necessarily be complete or
            up-to-date. Any of the material in the Services may be out of date at any given time, and we are under no
            obligation to update such material.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content or commercial communications
            as such.</p>
        <p>Although it is IAS’s intention for the Services to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions
            when the Services may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades,
            for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment.</p>
        <p>IAS reserves the right to remove any content from the Services for any reason, without prior notice. Content
            removed from the Services may continue to be stored by IAS, including, without limitation, in order to
            comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order.</p>
        <h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
        <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe
            that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in
            good faith that materials posted on the Services infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send IAS a
            “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The
            notice must include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works
                that have been allegedly infringed;</li>
            <li>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works
                located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>
            <li>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity,
                and information reasonably sufficient to allow IAS to locate the material on the Services;</li>
            <li>Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);</li>
            <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is
                not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
            <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the
                complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
                infringed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the
            DMCA permits you to send IAS a counter-notice.</p>
        <p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see
            http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services should
            be sent to Abelman, Frayne & Schwab, 666 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212-949-9022, dmca@lawabel.com.
            Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are
            penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
        <h2>Suggestions and Submissions</h2>
        <p>We appreciate hearing from our users and welcome your comments regarding the Services. Please be advised,
            however, that if you send us creative ideas, suggestions, inventions or materials (“creative ideas”), we
            shall:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>own, exclusively, all now known or later discovered rights to the creative ideas;</li>
            <li>not be subject to any obligation of confidentiality and not be liable for any use or disclosure of any
                creative ideas; and</li>
            <li>be entitled to unrestricted use of the creative ideas for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or
                otherwise, without compensation to you or any other person.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</h2>
        <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach thereof,
            including all arbitrability questions and questions regarding their existence, validity or termination,
            shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance
            with its Commercial Arbitration Rules by one arbitrator. The parties shall endeavor to agree upon the
            arbitrator, and if they fail to do so within twenty-one (21) days after the commencement of the Arbitration,
            the appointment shall be made by the AAA.</p>
        <p>The place, or legal seat of arbitration, shall be New York, New York, and the language of the arbitration
            shall be English.</p>
        <p>You may only bring claims in your individual capacity on your own behalf, and not in any representative
            capacity or on behalf of any class or purported class, and no arbitration you commence hereunder may be
            joined with or include any claims by any other persons.</p>
        <p>The arbitrator shall award the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator, its reasonable
            costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
            in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>No information concerning an arbitration, beyond the names of the parties, their counsel or the relief
            requested, may be unilaterally disclosed to a third party by any party, unless required by law. Any
            documentary or other evidence given by any party or witness in any arbitration shall be treated as
            confidential by any party whose access to such evidence arises exclusively because of its participation in
            the arbitration and shall not be disclosed to any third party (other than a witness or expert), except as
            may be required by law. Any party who commences any judicial proceeding in connection with an arbitration
            initiated hereunder shall endeavor to have the judicial record of any such proceeding sealed to the extent
            permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>Should any dispute or controversy arise out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy or
            the Services, it shall be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in New York
            County, New York, and shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict
            of law provisions.</p>
        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the
            Internet or the Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for
            implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus
            protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to the Sites for any
            reconstruction of any lost data.</p>
        <p>Violation of these Terms of Service may, in IAS’s sole discretion, result in termination of your use of the
            Services. You understand and agree that IAS cannot and will not be responsible for the content posted on the
            Services and you use the Services at your own risk. If you violate the letter or spirit of these Terms of
            Service, or otherwise create risk or possible legal exposure for IAS, we can stop providing all or part of
            the Services to you.</p>
        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IAS OFFERS THE SERVICES “AS-IS” AND MAKES NO
            REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE SERVICES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,

            COMPONENTS THROUGH USE OF OR DOWNLOADING MATERIAL FROM THE SERVICES.</p>
        <p>IAS DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION REGARDING USE OR THE RESULT OF USE OF THE IAS CONTENT IN
            TERMS OF ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.</p>
        <p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND THEIR CONTENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
            LAW AND THEN ONLY TO THAT EXTENT, IN NO EVENT WILL IAS, ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY
            HOLDERS, OWNERS, PARTNERS, MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, CONTRACTORS,
            LENDERS, ADVISORS, SPONSORS, VOLUNTEERS, INSURERS, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTATIVES, SUCCESSORS AND
            ASSIGNS (THE “IAS PARTIES”), BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT,
            PUNITIVE, ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF
            REVENUE OR INCOME, LOST PROFITS, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
            SERVICES, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY THAT ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH
            THE SERVICES (OR THE TERMINATION THEREOF FOR ANY REASON), EVEN IF THE IAS PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>THE IAS PARTIES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WHATSOEVER IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CONTENT POSTED ON THE
            SERVICES - INCLUDING CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO CONTENT POSTED ON THE SERVICES, FOR YOUR USE OF THE
            SERVICES, OR FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES WHETHER ON THE SERVICES OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
            PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION AND WILL SURVIVE THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOUR USE OF THE
            SERVICES.</p>
        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the IAS Parties from and against any claims, liabilities,
            damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising
            out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of the Services, including, but
            not limited to, your User Contributions, any use of the Services’ content, services and products other than

        <p>No waiver by IAS of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or
            continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of
            IAS to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right
