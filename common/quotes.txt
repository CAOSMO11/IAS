Let the winds of fortune sail you, and may you sail a gentle sea but let it always be the other fella who says, "Lads - this drink's on me."

- I drink to your health when I'm with you, I drink to your health when I'm alone, I drink to your health so often, I'm starting to worry about my own!

- Here's to a long life and a merry one. A quick death and an easy one. A pretty girl and an honest one. A cold pint - and another one!

- Slainte (Slanche)
